## üë®üèª‚ÄçüíªÔ∏è H1j4ck

This project is designed to demonstrate how malicious browser extensions can be used for educational purposes to understand security vulnerabilities and raise awareness on how hackers can exploit browser features. The goal is to educate users on how malicious extensions can be misused and how to protect against them.

## üß† How It Works

This educational project shows how a malicious browser extension could be used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as login credentials and session cookies. The extension, when installed in a user's browser, secretly monitors their login activities on websites. If a user logs in, it captures:

* **Login credentials (username/password)**
* **Session cookies**

This captured information is sent to the attacker's **Telegram**. The session cookies allow an attacker to bypass **two-factor** authentication, potentially giving them access to the user‚Äôs account, even if they are not logged in.

### **Step 1: Download the Extension from GitHub**
1. First, download your extension from **GitHub**, such as the **`H1j4ck-main.zip`** file.
2. Once downloaded, it will be in your **Downloads folder**.

---

### **Step 2: Extract the Zip File**
1. **Extract** the **`H1j4ck-main.zip`** file.
2. After extracting, a new folder will be created named **`H1j4ck-main`**.

   Inside this folder, you will find three files:
   - `manifest.json`
   - `content.js`
   - `background.js`

---

### **Step 3: Go to Chrome Extensions Page**
1. Open your **Google Chrome** browser.
2. In the browser's URL bar, type: `chrome://extensions/` and press **Enter**.
   
   This will take you to the **Extensions** page.

---

### **Step 4: Enable Developer Mode**
1. On the Extensions page, in the top right corner, you will see a toggle for **Developer mode**. Turn it **on**.

---

### **Step 5: Load the Extension**
1. After enabling Developer mode, click the **Load unpacked** button.
2. A folder dialog will pop up. Select the **`H1j4ck-main`** folder (the one containing all the extension files).
