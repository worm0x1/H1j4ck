This project is designed to demonstrate how malicious browser extensions can be used for educational purposes to understand security vulnerabilities and raise awareness on how hackers can exploit browser features. The goal is to educate users on how malicious extensions can be misused and how to protect against them.

## üß† How It Works

This educational project shows how a malicious browser extension could be used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as login credentials and session cookies. The extension, when installed in a user's browser, secretly monitors their login activities on websites. If a user logs in, it captures:

* **Login credentials (username/password)**
* **Session cookies**

This captured information is sent to the attacker's **Telegram**. The session cookies allow an attacker to bypass two-factor authentication, potentially giving them access to the user‚Äôs account, even if they are not logged in.
